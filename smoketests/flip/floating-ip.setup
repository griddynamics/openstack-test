Feature: Add pool of external IP's
    In order to have test floating IP feature
    As tester
    I want to Add pool of external IP's using nova-manage


    Scenario: Register pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I add pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}" exist
