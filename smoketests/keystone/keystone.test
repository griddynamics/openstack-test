Feature: Setup keystone on installed OpenStack
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As root
    I want to setup keystone

    Scenario: Install keystone
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            {% for package in packages_to_install %}
            | {{ package }}      |
            {% endfor %}
        And every RPM package available:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        When I install RPM package(s):
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        Then every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |


    Scenario: Setup nova and glance to use keystone
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |

#        When I change flag file "{{glance.api_conf}}" by setting flag values:
#            | Name               | Value                                                 |
#            | pipeline         | versionnegotiation authtoken auth-context apiv1app    |

#        And I change flag file "{{glance.registry_conf}}" by setting flag values:
#            | Name               | Value                                  |
#            | pipeline         |  authtoken auth-context registryapp    |

        And I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/pipeline = versionnegotiation context apiv1app/pipeline = versionnegotiation authtoken auth-context apiv1app/' "{{glance.api_conf}}"  |  noFail  |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/pipeline = context registryapp/pipeline = authtoken auth-context registryapp/' "{{glance.registry_conf}}"  |  noFail  |
            |  sudo mv -f /etc/nova/api-paste.ini /etc/nova/api-paste.ini.wokeystone  | noFail    |
            |  sudo dd if=/etc/keystone/nova-api-paste.ini of=/etc/nova/api-paste.ini  | noFail    |
            |  sudo sed -i 's/999888777666/"{{keystone.token}}"/' "{{nova.api_conf}}"  |  noFail  |

        And I init keystone db for IP "{{keystone.cc}}", admin "{{keystone.admin}}", password "{{keystone.admin_password}}", project "{{keystone.tenant}}", token "{{keystone.token}}", region "{{keystone.region}}"

        And I start services:
            | ServiceName        |
            | keystone |
        And I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        And every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
            | keystone |

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
            |  Command                            | Expected |
            |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
            |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |

#Feature: Check keystone service
#    In order to smoke test keystone functionality
#    As root
#    I want to create user, tenant, endpoints in keystone

    Scenario: Check user creating using keystone
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
            | keystone |
        When I create keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" with password "{{keystone.admin_password}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}"
        Then I see keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" exist

    Scenario: Grant permission for keystone user
        Given I see keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" exist
        When I grant role "Admin" for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}"
        Then I see role "Admin" granted for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}"

    Scenario: Create token
        Given I see keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" exist
        When I create token "{{keystone.token}}" for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}"
        Then I see token "{{keystone.token}}" for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}" exist


#Feature: Remove keystone
#    In order to clean environment after smoke test
#    As root
#    I want to remove keystone


    Scenario: Revert changes made to nova and glance
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName        |
            | openstack-keystone |
        And every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
            | keystone |


        When I stop services:
            | ServiceName        |
            | keystone |
        And I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |

            |  sudo rm -rf /etc/keystone     | noFail    |

        And I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
