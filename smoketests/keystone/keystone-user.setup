Feature: Check keystone service
    In order to smoke test keystone functionality
    As root
    I want to create user, tenant, endpoints in keystone


    Scenario: Check user creating using keystone
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
            | keystone |
        When I create keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" with password "{{keystone.admin_password}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}"
        Then I see keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" exist

    Scenario: Grant permission for keystone user
        Given I see keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" exist
        When I grant role "Admin" for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant ""
        And I grant role "Member" for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}"

# TODO
        Then I see role "Admin" granted for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant ""
        And I see role "Member" granted for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}"

    Scenario: Create token
        Given I see keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" exist
        When I create token "{{keystone.token}}" for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}"
        And I add credential for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}", tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}" to use "EC2" service using key "{{keystone.admin}}:{{keystone.tenant}}" and secrete "{{keystone.admin_password}}"
        Then I see token "{{keystone.token}}" for keystone user "{{keystone.admin}}" in tenant "{{keystone.tenant}}" exist
