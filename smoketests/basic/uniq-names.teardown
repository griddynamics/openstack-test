Feature: Clean-up after uniq names feature test
    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
    As tester
    I want to clean-up after uniq names feature test

    Scenario: Stop instances
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I stop VM instance "{{vm2.name}}"
        And I stop VM instance "{{vm2.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
