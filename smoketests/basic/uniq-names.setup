Feature: Change uniq-names flag and check it works
    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
    As tester

    Scenario: Enable uniq names flag in nova.conf
        Then every service is running:
                                      | ServiceName   |
                                      {% for service in openstack_services %}
                                      | {{ service }} |
                                      {% endfor %}
        When I change flag file "{{nova.conf_file}}" by setting flag values:
                                      |     Name             | Value |
                                      | --project_uniq_names | true  |
        And I restart services:
                                      |     ServiceName    |
                                      {% for service in openstack_services %}
                                      | {{service}}        |
                                      {% endfor %}


    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
            |  Command                            | Expected  |
            |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
            |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |
