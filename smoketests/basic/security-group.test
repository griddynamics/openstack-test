Feature: Change nova config to enable security groups
    In order to test security-group functionality
    As tester
    I want to change nova config

    Scenario: Configure OpenStack compute
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in packages_to_install %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I change flag file "{{nova.conf_file}}" by setting flag values:
            | Name                      | Value              |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  | false              |

         Then the following flags in file "{{nova.conf_file}}" are set to:
            | Name                      | Value              |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  | false              |


    Scenario: Restart OpenStack services
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in supplementary_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}

#Feature: Test security groups
#    In order to smoke test security group functionality
#    As tester
#    I want to start 3 instances in different security groups. Then allow traffic between 2 of them and check that allowed and disallowed traffic works as it should.



    Scenario: Add 3 security groups, check them added.
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg.name}}" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" does not exist
        When I add security group "{{sg.name}}"
        And I add security group "{{sg2.name}}"
        And I add security group "{{sg3.name}}"
        Then I see security group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist


    Scenario: Add rules for me to access instances
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist

        When I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg2.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg3.name}}"

        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg2.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}"

        Then I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg3.name}}" exist

        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}" exist



    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command               | Expected  |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq  |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |

        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I start VM instance "{{vm.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}",  flavor "{{vm.flavor}}", keypair "{{vm.keypair.name}}" in security groups "{{sg.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" comes up within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I can log into VM "{{vm.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}"

        Then VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" comes up within "{{vm2.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm2.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm2.ping_deadline}}" seconds

# Creating rules and checking traffic  ---------------


    Scenario: Add rule to allow all traffic from SG2 pass to SG3
