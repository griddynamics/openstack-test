#Feature: Add pool of external IP's
#    In order to have test floating IP feature
#    As tester
#    I want to Add pool of external IP's using nova-manage


    Scenario: Register pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I add pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}" existFeature: Allocate external IP and associate with instance,
    In order to test floating IP feature
    As tester
    I want to associate external IP with instance


    Scenario: Allocate external IP
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}" exist
        When I allocate address "{{floating.name}}"
        Then I see address "{{floating.name}}" allocated


    Scenario: Start instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I start VM instance "{{vm.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}",  flavor "{{vm.flavor}}" and keypair "{{vm.keypair.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" comes up within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol
        And I can log into VM "{{vm.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}"
        And I login to VM "{{vm.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |

    Scenario: Associate allocated IP with started instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I associate address "{{floating.name}}" with instance "{{vm.name}}"
        Then I see address "{{floating.name}}" associated with instance "{{vm.name}}"

    Scenario: Check floating IP
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        When I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  iptables -I OUTPUT -j ACCEPT                                    | noFail    |
        Then address "{{floating.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds




## CLEAN AFTER TEST ----------------------

    Scenario: De-associate IP from instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see address "{{floating.name}}" associated with instance "{{vm.name}}"
        When I de-associate address "{{floating.name}}" from instance "{{vm.name}}"
        Then I see address "{{floating.name}}" not associated with instance "{{vm.name}}"
        And I see address "{{floating.name}}" allocated


    Scenario: De-Allocate external IP
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see address "{{floating.name}}" allocated
        When I de-allocate address "{{floating.name}}"
        Then I see address "{{floating.name}}" not allocated


    Scenario: Stop instance
        Given VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        When I stop VM instance "{{vm.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds

    Scenario: Undo system changes
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  iptables -D OUTPUT -j ACCEPT                                    | noFail    |
        Then commands are executed without errors

#Feature: Remove pool of external IP's
#    In order to clean after test of floating IP feature
#    As tester
#    I want to remove pool of external IP's using nova-manage


    Scenario: Deregister pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}" exist
        When I remove pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{network.external.cidr}}" does not exist
