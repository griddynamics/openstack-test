Feature: Change uniq-names flag and check it works
    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
    As tester

    Scenario: Enable uniq names flag in nova.conf
        Then every service is running:
                                      | ServiceName   |
                                      {% for service in openstack_services %}
                                      | {{ service }} |
                                      {% endfor %}
        When I change flag file "{{nova.conf_file}}" by setting flag values:
                                      |     Name             | Value |
                                      | --project_uniq_names | true  |
        And I restart services:
                                      |     ServiceName    |
                                      {% for service in openstack_services %}
                                      | {{service}}        |
                                      {% endfor %}


    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
            |  Command                            | Expected  |
            |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
            |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |



#Feature: Check uniq names feature
#    In order to smoke test OpenStack build
#    As tester
#    I want to register start instance and verify it is up and available. Check i can not start instance with same name

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "single-node ! novaclient-users ! novaclient-network ! novaclient-images ! novaclient-keys"

    Scenario: Start multiple instances with same name when unique instance names enabled
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And the following flags in file "{{nova.conf_file}}" are set to:
                                      |     Name             | Value |
                                      | --project_uniq_names | true  |

        When I start VM instance "{{vm.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}", flavor "{{vm.flavor}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" comes up within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds


    Scenario: Check we can not start instancr with same name
        Given VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
# TODO
#        Then I can not start VM instance "{{vm.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}", flavor "{{vm.flavor}}"


    Scenario: Stop instances after test
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I stop VM instance "{{vm.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds




    Scenario: Disable uniq names flag in nova.conf
        Then every service is running:
                                      | ServiceName   |

                                      | {{ service }} |
                                      {% endfor %}
        When I change flag file "{{nova.conf_file}}" by setting flag values:
                                      |     Name             | Value |
                                      | --project_uniq_names | False  |
        And I restart services:
                                      |     ServiceName    |
                                      {% for service in openstack_services %}
                                      | {{service}}        |
                                      {% endfor %}

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
            |  Command                            | Expected  |
            |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
            |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |


    Scenario: Start multiple instances with same name when unique instance names disabled
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And the following flags in file "{{nova.conf_file}}" are set to:
                                      |     Name             | Value |
                                      | --project_uniq_names | False  |
        When I start VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}", flavor "{{vm2.flavor}}"
        And I start VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}", flavor "{{vm2.flavor}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" comes up within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds

    Scenario: Stop instances
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I stop VM instance "{{vm2.name}}"
        And I stop VM instance "{{vm2.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
