Feature: Change nova config to enable security groups
    In order to test security-group functionality
    As tester
    I want to change nova config

    Scenario: Configure OpenStack compute
        Given every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in packages_to_install %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I change flag file "{{nova.conf_file}}" by setting flag values:
            | Name                      | Value              |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  | false              |

         Then the following flags in file "{{nova.conf_file}}" are set to:
            | Name                      | Value              |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  | false              |


    Scenario: Restart OpenStack services
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in supplementary_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
